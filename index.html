        <p>Coming up in March 2025, Alyssa and I have the opportunity to join our church’s mission team and travel to Osaka, Japan to share the love of Jesus. Last March 2023, Blake and I travelled to Osaka where we spent every day working alongside Suita Church.</p>
        <p>While we are there, we will have the privilege to help our local missionaries, Mark and Mie Busby. The Busby’s are wonderful missionaries and are not strangers to Japan, in fact, they have been serving in Tokyo for years and have moved to their new home in Osaka. This is where our team is going to come in. Osaka is a large port city in Japan with people from all over the world. Many of the people of Japan have never heard how much God loves and how He wants to have a personal relationship with them. On the Sunday that we are there, we will help the Busby’s with all of the classes in their Sunday service. The remainder of the time we are there will be within the community showing how much we care for them and sharing Christ to the people of Osaka.</p>
        <p>While I was there with Blake last year, I met Tony. While we will never know the full impact of what God did while we were there in 2023, we saw the transformation in Tony’s life when he accepted Jesus and how he has continued to grow and follow him to this day. Tony was born in China and moved to Japan for work opportunities to care for himself and his teenage son. Now, he has a relationship with Jesus and continues to learn more as he attends discipleship weekly.</p>
        <h2>Two ways you can help!</h2>
        <p><b>Prayer…</b> Pray that each child and adult we speak to sees God’s love for them; the ones that hear what Jesus has done for them see their need for Him, and the ones that follow Him share with others. Also, pray that God uses this to help us have a closer relationship with Him.</p>
        <p><b>Financially…</b> We must raise the entire cost of the trip ($2500 each). All of the team members are responsible for raising their funds.</p>
        <p>If you are able and willing to help us out in this area, please send a check made payable to Willowbrook Baptist Church, and indicate Howell - Japan in the memo. All contributions by checks and Willowbrook link (QR Code) when selected are tax deductible.</p>
        <p>Mail Checks to:<br /><b>1400 Blevins Gap Rd SE<br />Huntsville, AL 35802<br />Add Memo: Howell - Japan</b></p>
